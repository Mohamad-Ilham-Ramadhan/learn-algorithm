   - Trapping Rain Water (Hard) fail
Binary Search: 
   - 875. Koko Eating Bananas (medium)
   - 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (hard)
      - I can answer in O(n+m) time complexity but cannot in O(log(n+m))
Linked list: 
   - 287. Find the Duplicate Number (medium)
      - cannot make space O(1), I solve using hash set which is O(n)
Tree:
   - subtree of another tree (easy)
      - (success) without fail after come back completing Blind 75. Maybe because my intuition grow stronger.
1D dynamic programming:
   - coin change (medium)
   - longest increasing subsequence (medium): [SOLVED O(n^2)] but cannot make up to O(n log n) as suggested.
   - word break (medium): time limit exeeded
