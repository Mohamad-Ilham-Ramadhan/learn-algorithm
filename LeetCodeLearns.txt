Lesson learned in solving LeetCode problems:
   - We can use Floyd's hare and tortoise algorithm to detect a cycle in linked list. So we can make time complexity to O(1) instead use a hashmap will be O(n) 
   
   - Use tree and backtracking to find combinations of something like pair of parentheses.
   
   - We can use slow and fast pointers to determine the mid point of a linked list:
      # initial position
      1->2->3->4->5
      s  f
      # 2
      1->2->3->4->5
         s     f
      # 3
      1->2->3->4->5
            s        f
      # 4 both lists are:
      1->2->3  and  4->5
