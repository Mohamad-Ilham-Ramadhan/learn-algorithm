Leetcode questions that must re-solved because I learn new solution that more fast than mine.
Why this approach is because I have to build intuition around the better solution.

   - (backtracking) leetcode: 51. N-Queens (hard)
      - save placed queen's diagonals in hashset 

   - (Graph) leetcode: 127. word ladder (hard)
      - create pattern for optimal finding neighbor words
         {
            '*ot': ['lot', 'dot', 'hot']
            'd*g': ['dog']
            '*og' : ['dog', 'cog']
         }
