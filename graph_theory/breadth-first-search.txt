=== Overview ===

   The Breadth First Search (BFS) is another fundamental search algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It runs with a time complexity of O(V+E) and is often used as a building block in other algorithms.

   The BFS algorithm is particularly useful for one thing: [finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs]
